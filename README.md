# READ BEFORE USING

# 1. How to make it work?
1. Download the file,
2. Make sure roblox is opened before opening the program,
3. When you are ready to use the program (when you are next to your booth) open the file,
4. Switch app to roblox, make sure the roblox app is top most, otherwise it won't work
5. Script should start working after 5 seconds from opening the file

# 2. Important
Roblox app has to be on top most, otherwise it won't work,
Cmd has to be always opened, otherwise it won't work,
Don't click anything on your keyboard, the script is automatically typing on chat, that means its possible to break the message,
If you want to stop the program, just close the cmd
Script is automatically sending messages after 20 seconds
Keep in mind that setting the delay to low numbers might result in getting banned

# 3. Customizing the program
1. Download VSC (Visual Studio Code),
2. Open VSC,
3. Select "File", then choose "Open File", find and select program you downloaded (auto text plsdonate.py),
4. If you did everything correctly, the code should appear,
5. Change messages that are being send, just edit messages in "..." where it says "# List of messages to send"
6. Change delay between sending messages from originally (20) to whatever you want where it says "# Wait (...) seconds before sending the next message"

# 4. Is this file safe?
Yes, it is, its open sourced python file, you can edit it however you want.
